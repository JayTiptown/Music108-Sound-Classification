# Urban Sound Classification

Final project for Music 108 -- Perception and Cognition in Music. 

I built a classification model to classify given environmental sounds in urban settings, such as the sound of traffic, pedestrians, trains, and a plethora of related urban sounds. Try it yourself and see if an uploaded recording of an urban setting is correctly classified!
